Hey All! CryptoPoppin here! Figuring this out as I go to verify a project on CNFT. Any advice is appreciated. Currently working on NFTs and learning the ropes with minting and verification. Not really looking to collaborate on anything at the moment as I have a team of me and one other artists currently handling everything. On the side I like to hike, backpack, camp when my eyeballs arent being sucked into the back of my head from staring at screens all day. Feel free to hit me up on Facebook : CryptoPoppin , on Twitter @cryptopoppin1 or on Instagram @cryptopoppin
